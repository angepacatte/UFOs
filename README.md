## Overview

  The purpose of this project was to pull in data of UFO sightings into a webpage.  It has a table that has columns for Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments.  A nasa.jpg was imported to style the page.  The final product shown in image below.

## Results

Once the data was loaded into the url, search bars were created for each category in the data except for duration and comments.  These search bars will create a separate table by filtering with what was typed into the search bars.  Example shown below.

Another example of two searches at the same time to filter out the city and state.  The user must hit tab to the next search bar before the filtering will be performed.

## Summary

In conclusion, this webpage was created to pull in a table that had UFO sighting data.  It allows for someone to search for specific details or types of UFO sightings.  A downfall of the webpage is the amount of data.  There are not that many sightings so a person could look through the data quickly without searching.  When searching, if specifics are not known, nothing may be pulled up.  Again this is because there are not that many sightings listed.  I think to improve this webpage, more data points need to be added.

I believe more styling could also be added to the page to make it more appealing.  More styling with font, background, etc. would help with the overall look of the webpage.
